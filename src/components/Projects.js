      <p>Here are some examples of projects I've done so far:</p>
      <div>
        <p>Codecademy front-end engineer course project.</p>
        <p>
          This project was done as a final project in Codecademy Front-end Engineer Career path.
          The goal of the project was to build an application
          that you are passionate about building.
          I love to challenge myself by learning new habits which take me closer to my goals.
          For that reason, I decided to build a simple habit tracker.
          This project gave me an opportunity to
          learn new technologies such as React Native and Expo.
        </p>
        <p>Skills used: JavaScript, React Native, Expo, AsyncStorage</p>
      </div>
    </section>
